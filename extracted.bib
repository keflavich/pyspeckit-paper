  abstract =      {We report on an informal survey about the use of
                   software in the worldwide astronomical community. The
                   survey was carried out between December 2014 and
                   February 2015, collecting responses from 1142
                   astronomers, spanning all career levels. We find that
                   all participants use software in their research. The
                   vast majority of participants, 90%, write at least
                   some of their own software. Even though writing
                   software is so wide-spread among the survey
                   participants, only 8% of them report that they have
                   received substantial training in software
                   development. Another 49% of the participants have
                   received "little" training. The remaining 43% have
                   received no training. We also find that astronomers'
                   software stack is fairly narrow. The 10 most popular
                   tools among astronomers are (from most to least
                   popular): Python, shell scripting, IDL, C/C++,
                   Fortran, IRAF, spreadsheets, HTML/CSS, SQL and
                   Supermongo. Across all participants the most common
                   programing language is Python ($67\pm 2\%$), followed
                   by IDL ($44\pm 2\%$), C/C++ ($37\pm 2\%$) and Fortran
                   ($28\pm 2\%$). IRAF is used frequently by $24\pm 1\%$
                   of participants. We show that all trends are largely
                   independent of career stage, area of research and
                   geographic location.},

                   handled by a wide range of astronomical software
                   packages. Since the FITS format definition document
                   (the ``standard'') was last printed in this journal
                   in 2001, several new features have been developed and
                   standardized, notably support for 64-bit integers in
                   images and tables, variable-length arrays in tables,
                   and new world coordinate system conventions which
                   provide a mapping from an element in a data array to
                   a physical coordinate on the sky or within a
                   spectrum. The FITS Working Group of the International
                   Astronomical Union has therefore produced this new
                   version 3.0 of the FITS standard, which is provided

                   reorganize many of the sections. Also included are
                   some appendices which are not formally part of the

                   Most of LOFAR's standard data products will be stored
                   using HDF5; the beam-formed time-series data and

                   from project-specific binary format to HDF5. We
                   report on our effort to pave the way towards new
                   astronomical data encapsulation using HDF5, which can
                   be used by future ground and space projects. The
                   LOFAR project has formed a collaboration with NRAO,

                   the SKA pathfinders (ASKAP, MeerKAT, MWA, LWA), and

                   sampler for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposed
                   by Goodman & Weare (2010). The code is open source
                   and has already been used in several published
                   projects in the astrophysics literature. The
                   algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over
                   traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has
                   excellent performance as measured by the
                   autocorrelation time (or function calls per
                   independent sample). One major advantage of the
                   algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1
                   or 2 parameters compared to ~N2 for a traditional
                   algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In
                   this document, we describe the algorithm and the
                   details of our implementation. Exploiting the
                   parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any
                   user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without
                   extra effort. The code is available online at
                   http://dan.iel.fm/emcee under the GNU General Public

  abstract =      {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for
                   model assessment, model comparison, convergence
                   diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In
                   this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in
                   using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent
                   problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can
                   only be estimated for linear models. Concerning
                   nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is
                   unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the
                   value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise
                   in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared
                   itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is
                   uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of
                   reduced chi-squared for differentiating between
                   models or assessing convergence of a minimisation
                   procedure. The impact of noise on the value of
                   reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in
                   particular for small data sets, which are very common
                   in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced
                   chi-squared can only be used with due caution for
                   linear models, whereas it must not be used for
                   nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more
                   sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also
                   applicable to nonlinear models.},

  abstract =      {Estimating errors is a crucial part of any scientific
                   analysis. Whenever a parameter is estimated
                   (model-based or not), an error estimate is necessary.
                   Any parameter estimate that is given without an error
                   estimate is meaningless. Nevertheless, many
                   (undergraduate or graduate) students have to teach
                   such methods for error estimation to themselves when
                   working scientifically for the first time. This
                   manuscript presents an easy-to-understand overview of
                   different methods for error estimation that are
                   applicable to both model-based and model-independent
                   parameter estimates. These methods are not discussed
                   in detail, but their basics are briefly outlined and
                   their assumptions carefully noted. In particular, the
                   methods for error estimation discussed are grid
                   search, varying $\chi^2$, the Fisher matrix,
                   Monte-Carlo methods, error propagation, data
                   resampling, and bootstrapping. Finally, a method is
                   outlined how to propagate measurement errors through
                   complex data-reduction pipelines.},
