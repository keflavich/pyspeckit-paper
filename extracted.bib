  abstract =      {We report on an informal survey about the use of
                   software in the worldwide astronomical community. The
                   survey was carried out between December 2014 and
                   February 2015, collecting responses from 1142
                   astronomers, spanning all career levels. We find that
                   all participants use software in their research. The
                   vast majority of participants, 90%, write at least
                   some of their own software. Even though writing
                   software is so wide-spread among the survey
                   participants, only 8% of them report that they have
                   received substantial training in software
                   development. Another 49% of the participants have
                   received "little" training. The remaining 43% have
                   received no training. We also find that astronomers'
                   software stack is fairly narrow. The 10 most popular
                   tools among astronomers are (from most to least
                   popular): Python, shell scripting, IDL, C/C++,
                   Fortran, IRAF, spreadsheets, HTML/CSS, SQL and
                   Supermongo. Across all participants the most common
                   programing language is Python ($67\pm 2\%$), followed
                   by IDL ($44\pm 2\%$), C/C++ ($37\pm 2\%$) and Fortran
                   ($28\pm 2\%$). IRAF is used frequently by $24\pm 1\%$
                   of participants. We show that all trends are largely
                   independent of career stage, area of research and
                   geographic location.},

                   handled by a wide range of astronomical software
                   packages. Since the FITS format definition document
                   (the ``standard'') was last printed in this journal
                   in 2001, several new features have been developed and
                   standardized, notably support for 64-bit integers in
                   images and tables, variable-length arrays in tables,
                   and new world coordinate system conventions which
                   provide a mapping from an element in a data array to
                   a physical coordinate on the sky or within a
                   spectrum. The FITS Working Group of the International
                   Astronomical Union has therefore produced this new
                   version 3.0 of the FITS standard, which is provided
                   here in its entirety. In addition to describing the
                   new features in FITS, numerous editorial changes were
                   made to the previous version to clarify and
                   reorganize many of the sections. Also included are
                   some appendices which are not formally part of the
                   standard. The FITS standard is likely to undergo

                   Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) project is solving the

                   Most of LOFAR's standard data products will be stored
                   using HDF5; the beam-formed time-series data and
                   transient buffer board data have already transitioned
                   from project-specific binary format to HDF5. We
                   report on our effort to pave the way towards new
                   astronomical data encapsulation using HDF5, which can
                   be used by future ground and space projects. The
                   LOFAR project has formed a collaboration with NRAO,

                   implementation of the affine-invariant ensemble
                   sampler for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposed
                   by Goodman & Weare (2010). The code is open source
                   and has already been used in several published
                   projects in the astrophysics literature. The
                   algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over
                   traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has
                   excellent performance as measured by the
                   autocorrelation time (or function calls per
                   independent sample). One major advantage of the
                   algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1
                   or 2 parameters compared to ~N2 for a traditional
                   algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In
                   this document, we describe the algorithm and the
                   details of our implementation. Exploiting the
                   parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any
                   user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without
                   extra effort. The code is available online at
